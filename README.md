# Maze-Path-Finder
<p> Designed and implemented a maze navigation system in Java to find a valid path between two points while avoiding obstacles (ghosts) using Depth-First Search (DFS).</p>

<p>Built a custom Maze class to model the grid with dynamic ghost placement and developed a Pathfinder class to perform safe traversal with backtracking logic.</p>

<p>Implemented custom exception handling for invalid or unreachable paths, and ensured optimized grid traversal using visited node tracking and direction vectors.</p>

<p>Strengthened understanding of graph traversal algorithms, recursion, and Java collections like Stack and List.</p>
